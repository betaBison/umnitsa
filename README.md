umnitsa_robot is a [metapackage](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/package.xml#Metapackages) for all the packages that run on the robot's computer. Packages are located in the `src/` directory and a brief description of each is included below.

## Setup
This package is currently compatible with the Raspberry Pi 3 B+ and Jetson Nano.
   
### Raspberry Pi
Install needed dependencies:  
`pip install`

### Jetson Nano
Install needed dependencies:  
`pip install Jetson.GPIO`

Since this repo contains the realsesnse-ros repository as a submodule it's important to run the following command  
`git clone --recursive <URL to git repo>`  
If you failed to do this initially, then inside this repository run  
`git submodule update --init --recursive`  
The realsense-ros also requires the latest [Intel RealSense SDK](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/releases). Jetson Nano [installation instructions](https://github.com/JetsonHacksNano/installLibrealsense).

### Desktop
Since this repo contains the realsesnse-ros repository as a submodule it's important to run the following command  
`git clone --recursive <URL to git repo>`  
If you failed to do this initially, then inside this repository run  
`git submodule update --init --recursive`  
The realsense-ros also requires the latest [Intel RealSense SDK](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/releases). Linux [installation instructions](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/blob/master/doc/distribution_linux.md). You must install the dev package  
`sudo apt install librealsense2-dkms librealsense2-utils librealsense2-dev`   
   
Install pygame for the joystick controller  
`pip2 install pygame`



## Package Overview
### umnitsa_robot
Empty package that declares packages inside the [metapackage](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/package.xml#Metapackages).

### umnitsa_robot_launch
This package contains parameters adn launch files for the umnitsa robot. Parameters should be adjusted for compatibility with system setup.

### umnitsa_hardware
This package consists of the harware interfacing nodes as follows:
#### motors
outputs to the motor control board to control four DC motors  

Normal mode:  
The max throttle going forward is 71% on all motors, not 100%. This is so that moving the joystick in a steady
circle produces a steady cirlce of robot movement.  

Turbo mode:  
If the joystick is moved at all, one of the motors is set to 100% throttle. This makes it faster, but unfit for precise movement.

#### RGB
Outputs to the UmnitsaRGB custom PCB  

#### ultrasonic
Inputs from the UmnitsaUltra custom PCB

### umnitsa_joystick
Package that contains the node that that receives input from a switch pro controller and outputs to the joystick message.
