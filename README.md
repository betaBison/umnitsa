## Package Overview
### umnitsa_robot
Empty package that declares packages inside the [metapackage](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/package.xml#Metapackages).

### umnitsa_robot_launch
This package contains parameters adn launch files for the umnitsa robot. Parameters should be adjusted for compatibility with system setup.

### umnitsa_hardware
This package consists of the harware interfacing nodes as follows:
#### motors
outputs to the motor control board to control four DC motors  

Normal mode:  
The max throttle going forward is 71% on all motors, not 100%. This is so that moving the joystick in a steady
circle produces a steady cirlce of robot movement.  

Turbo mode:  
If the joystick is moved at all, one of the motors is set to 100% throttle. This makes it faster, but unfit for precise movement.

#### RGB
Outputs to the UmnitsaRGB custom PCB  

#### ultrasonic
Inputs from the UmnitsaUltra custom PCB

### umnitsa_joystick
Package that contains the node that that receives input from a switch pro controller and outputs to the joystick message.
